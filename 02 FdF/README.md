# Fdf

`Fdf` is a program that interprets a map provided as a parameter. The map is represented by a matrix where each number corresponds to a height value. The program generates a 3D visualization of the map in a separate window. You can close the window by clicking the "X" button or pressing the `ESC` key.

## Bonus

The `bonus` rule compiles an enhanced version of the `fdf` program with additional features. This version supports color interpretation and includes interactive controls:

- **Mouse Scroll**: Zoom in and out.
- **W, A, S, D Keys**: Move the map view.
- **Arrow Keys**: Rotate the map.

These interactive controls allow for a more dynamic and immersive exploration of the 3D representation.
